# The Wild Oasis

Welcome to **The Wild Oasis** – a modern hotel management platform tailored for hotel employees to manage cabins, bookings, and guests efficiently.  
Built with **React**, **Supabase**, and a range of modern tools, this application is designed for seamless, real-time operations directly from the hotel lobby.

## 🏨 About the Project

**The Wild Oasis** was built to streamline hotel operations for staff, not guests.  
Employees can manage everything from bookings to cabin details, monitor payments, and handle guest services like breakfast orders — all from one central application.

Because this app is designed for **internal use only**, it's optimized for desktop usage and runs on a dedicated computer in the lobby (no mobile support needed).

Only authenticated employees can access the system, and only authorized staff can create new accounts for other team members — ensuring full control and security.
